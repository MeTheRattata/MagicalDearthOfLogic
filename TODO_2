TODO 2:

DONE 1. Set up negative - positive move thingo
	*positive moves = healing moves
	*negative moves = damage dealing moves
	*just add the value to the entity's health and theres no need to check if its a heal or an attack
	
2. Make player use the universal attackTarget for all moves, not just damage dealing ones

3. Start using an array of entities to handle all the things
	*make a player object, and then put it into an array
	*Player player = new Player();    entities[0] = player;
	*Both are references to player, therefore both will work for using the player's methodss
