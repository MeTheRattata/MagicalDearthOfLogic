1. Use Activateable interface methods to determine whether an object is active or not.
   If an object is active, give it the next MouseClick event until it deactivates.
   Paint an object if its active, don't paint it if its not.
2. Set up a quick array of "Set up" menus (player select, companion select), activate
   and deactivate them one by one as you go through them.
3. Set up an arrayList / other type of list to go through all of the other active and 
   inactive objects, giving them MouseClick events in turn.
4. Determine how much MouseClicks each entity needs.
   Example: a Player has 2 menus, a moveSelect and a targetSelect menu. It needs 2 MouseClicks.
   However, a Companion only has a targetSelect, so it only needs one MouseClick.
